        <h1>Olympic Branding Project - Chiang Mai, Thailand</h1>
        <h2>Graphic Design 2 - Spring 2024</h2>
        <p>The task of this group project was to create forms of branding & logo work for a fictional Olympic event set in the year 2040 in Chiang Mai, Thailand. <br> My role in this peoject was to create the pictograms for select events along with accompanying tickets. I used my knowledge of linework and color to <br> create a circle pattern behind the pictograms that is meant to resemble the popular bamboo umbrellas you would find in that city. I also used <br> characteristics of Thai lettering to create the pictograms.</p>

        <h1>Expressive Words Project</h1>
        <h2>Graphic Design 1 - Fall 2023</h2>
        <p>In this project, we were given a group of words to create animations with based on their literal definitions. I was given the words "Catch" and "Release" <br> and I created an animation in After Effects where a cage made up of the word "Release" swings back and forth and drops letters from the inside. <br> Then a giant C roll sover and catches the falling letters, creating the word "Catch" while the letters are falling. I also incorperated a number of sound <br> effects to the actions in the video.</p>

        <h1>Netflix Banner Project</h1>
        <h2>Graphic Design 2 - Spring 2024</h2>
        <p>The objective of this project was to create a banner for a made up show that we were responsible for making a rough plot idea for, along with stills <br> from a hypothetical title sequence. I gave my show a psychological horror theme with an element of time and titled it "The Muddy Rainbow". The plot <br> is about a man who wakes up in a reality where he gets everything he ever wanted but at the cost of a looming threat approaching as time passes. <br> The glitch effects were created in Adobe Illustrator with the use of royalty free images. </p>

        <h1>Message Piece</h1>
        <h2>2D Fundamentals - Spring 2023</h2>
        <p>The task of this project was to create a piece with some kind of message using scanned cutouts and strictly black and white. My idea was to do a <br> piece about climate change where waves expand slowly out from the Earth. I created an earth cutout and a blossomish wave design and scanned <br> them into Photoshop. After that I used layers and did stacking of multiple waves to create the piece. I also created a version with a glitch effect just <br> to see what it might look like with color in it.</p>
